This repository uses ARIMA models to forecast CO2. Cross-validation and Grid Search are used to select the best ARIMA model. Two different forecasting strategies are used in the repository: (1) we use 10-periods-ahead forecasting, and (2) we iterate a one-period-ahead forecasting strategy. The latter strategy proves to be more performant than the first strategy. Finally, we do not report all the details about the dataset used in this repository, as the the data that is used in this repository is fully described at the following link: https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/datasets/generated/co2.html
